1. An ideal github network needs to support the following tasks, using the theory from Lee et al.

- Sort: Temporal and Sequential sorting of commits to understand when they are created
- Retrieve Value: The ability to find additional information about a given commit i.e. the author, unique id
- Characterise Distribution: The distribution of commits and activity over time will be of interest
- Connectivity: Find bridges and articulation points to gain an overview of the network, also identify connected components to identify open and closed branches, forks
- Follow Path: Follow a given path between nodes
- Revisit: Return to a previously visited node
- Scan and Overview: Overview of activity level, ability to see at a glance the different branches, ability to see active and inactive branches at a glance
