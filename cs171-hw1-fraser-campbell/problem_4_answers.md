1. Q: What does (d3.selectAll("tbody tr")[0].length-1) mean? -- A: This is the number of rows containing data values. This is the case as the selectAll("..") selects all elements "tr" contained within "tbody". This returns an object which has as it's first value an array of all the "tr" elements. The .length property calculates the length of this array.

2. The function 'color' reurns a color for each of the integers given within the domain method. This color is a linear interpolation of the color arguments given to the range function, calling color(0) returns `#ff4500` the hex code for orange-red, calling color(10) returns the hex code for a predominately orange-red color with a little silver, calling color(150) returns `#42ffff`, the hex code for a cyan color.

3. If the array passed to `domain()` instead contained the minimum and maximum "Rate" values - in this case 2.6 to 9.0, respectively - the scale would be narrowed significantly. The scale would only map values between 2.6 and 9.0 to a hex color code between orange-red and silver, instead of doing so for values between 0 and 50; 50 is one less than the number rows in the body of our table. This would be appropriate if we were trying to visually encode the rate of unemployment in each state instead of the sorted position of each row.
