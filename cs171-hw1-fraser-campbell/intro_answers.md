1. To improve the ease of understanding summary statistics at a glance we could include summary statistics as part of the table, possibly the mean and the mode, the median is not likely to have much value in this case. We could also include a grey scale on the data to give an indication of realtive size or even a minature bar chart as part of the cell to indicate this.

2. a) The periodic table http://www.webelements.com/ - This is a good example of well presented tabular information, it involves color to separate elements based upon their types, the cells in each column belong to a different group and the rows are incremented by a well defined property.. Because of the design it is easy to segment with your eye a particular group of elements you are interested in.
	b) This table is a reasonable example http://www.udel.edu/htr/Statistics/Images/school.gif - The columns and rows are easily delineated by the eye and there is not much unnecessary ink used. Totals are easily identified by the eye and groupings/ white space is well used to allow easy comparison.
